# DripUI CLI

The *drip-cli* lets you create and modify new/existing components.

`cd` into your DripUI workspace and run `drip` to interact with the CLI.

```bash
cd DripUI
drip
```

> **Note**:

- The `drip` command only works if you run it in the root directory (i.e the DripUI directory). Calling the command elsewhere will throw an error.

- If you are on Windows, run the `drip` command from GitBash or WSL
